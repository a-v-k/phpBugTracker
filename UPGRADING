First, backup your database!  This upgrade should go smoothly, but
if it doesn't, it's better to be safe than sorry.

Upgrading from 0.9.1 to 1.0
---------------------------
PEAR and PEAR DB have been removed from the phpBT distribution. If you
have a  system-wide install of PEAR  that is available  in the include
path you  should set  the new PEAR_PATH  constant in config.php  to an
empty string  ('').  To reuse the  old pear files from 0.9.1, copy the
inc/pear/ directory from phpBT 0.9.1 and set PEAR_PATH to 'inc/pear/'.

Following the steps below will upgrade your installation of phpBT.

Using the directory where you unpacked the new set of files...
1. Edit config-dist.php, changing the database settings to match those
   from your old config.php (DB_*, TBL_PREFIX and PEAR_PATH constants).
   Save config-dist.php as config.php.
2. Load upgrade.php with your web browser.
3. After running that script your installation has been upgraded.
4. Either copy the files from the new installation over the old one, or
   point your users to the new location.

With phpBT 1.0 it is possible  to flag each Status as either "Open" or
"Closed".   The  upgrade  script  leaves  all  bugs  open.   You  must
therefore set your  statuses to either open or  closed by visiting the
admin pages.  Default settings  should be modified so that "resolved",
"closed",  and "verified"  are shown  as being  closed, and  all other
statuses are set to open.


Upgrading from 1.0 RCx to 1.0 RC6
---------------------------------
PEAR and PEAR DB have been removed from the phpBT distribution. If you
have a  system-wide install of PEAR  that is available  in the include
path you  should set  the new PEAR_PATH  constant in config.php  to an
empty string  ('').  To reuse the  old pear files  from RCx,  copy the
inc/pear/ directory and set PEAR_PATH to 'inc/pear/'.

Using the directory where you unpacked the new set of files...
1. Edit config-dist.php, changing the database settings to match those
   from your old config.php (DB_*, TBL_PREFIX and PEAR_PATH constants).
   Save config-dist.php as config.php.
2. Either copy the files from the new installation over the old one, or
   point your users to the new location.
   
There is no need to run the upgrade script.  The upgrade is complete.


Upgrading from 1.0.1 to 1.0.2
-----------------------------
It is best to delete your old "config.php" and make a new one.  Start
with "config-dist.php", and copy over your database connection parameters.
Sorry this is not more automated.

Run the "upgrade.php" script to upgrade your database from version 4
to version 5.  The main new tables are for bookmarks and groups.

Known issue: if you are logged in to your old version of phpBugTracker,
you'll get "DB Error: syntax error" on various feature of the new phpBugTracker.
Visit your "Personal Page", and click "Submit" to reset the bug list columns.


Upgrading from 1.0.2 to 1.0.3
-----------------------------
There is no database update required.

Note that "You must have magic_quotes_gpc set to On either in php.ini or in .htaccess".
This has always been true, but you might miss this warning while upgrading.  This avoids
SQL injection attacks.

Upgrading from 1.0.3/4 to 1.0.5
-------------------------------
There is no database update required, sort of.  On mysql upgrading to database version
6 results in three new indexes (for speed).  There is no schema change.
This is a very seamless upgrade.
