First, backup your database!  This upgrade should go smoothly, but
if it doesn't, it's better to be safe than sorry.


Upgrading from 0.9.1 to 1.0
---------------------------

PEAR and PEAR DB have been removed from the phpBT distribution. If you
have a  system-wide install of PEAR  that is available  in the include
path you  should set  the new PEAR_PATH  constant in config.php  to an
empty string  ('').  To reuse the  old pear files from 0.9.1, copy the
inc/pear/ directory from phpBT 0.9.1 and set PEAR_PATH to 'inc/pear/'.


Following the steps below will upgrade your installation of phpBT.

Using the directory where you unpacked the new set of files...
1. Edit config-dist.php, changing the database settings to match those
   from your old config.php (DB_*, TBL_PREFIX and PEAR_PATH constants).
   Save config-dist.php as config.php.
2. Load upgrade.php with your web browser.
3. After running that script your installation has been upgraded.
4. Either copy the files from the new installation over the old one, or
   point your users to the new location.

With phpBT 1.0 it is possible  to flag each Status as either "Open" or
"Closed".   The  upgrade  script  leaves  all  bugs  open.   You  must
therefore set your  statuses to either open or  closed by visiting the
admin pages.  Default settings  should be modified so that "resolved",
"closed",  and "verified"  are shown  as being  closed, and  all other
statuses are set to open.


Upgrading from 1.0 RCx to 1.0 RC6
---------------------------------

PEAR and PEAR DB have been removed from the phpBT distribution. If you
have a  system-wide install of PEAR  that is available  in the include
path you  should set  the new PEAR_PATH  constant in config.php  to an
empty string  ('').  To reuse the  old pear files  from RCx,  copy the
inc/pear/ directory and set PEAR_PATH to 'inc/pear/'.

Using the directory where you unpacked the new set of files...
1. Edit config-dist.php, changing the database settings to match those
   from your old config.php (DB_*, TBL_PREFIX and PEAR_PATH constants).
   Save config-dist.php as config.php.
2. Either copy the files from the new installation over the old one, or
   point your users to the new location.
   
There is no need to run the upgrade script.  The upgrade is complete.


Upgrading from 1.0.1 to developer CVS
-------------------------------------
You can recycle your old "config.php", however first change
	define ('CUR_DB_VERSION', 4);
to
	define ('CUR_DB_VERSION', 5);
Then after first login, run "upgrade.php" to update the database schema.
"upgrade.php" is not yet complete, so you'll have to do some hacking.
