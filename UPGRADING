First, backup your database!  This upgrade should go smoothly, but
if it doesn't, it's better to be safe than sorry.

Upgrading from 0.9.1 to 1.0
---------------------------

PEAR and PEAR DB have been removed from the distribution, so they must either
be available in the include path (system-wide install of PEAR) or their location
should be specified in the PEAR_PATH constant definition in config-dist.php

Following the steps below will upgrade your installation of phpBT.

Using the directory where you unpacked the new set of files...
1. Edit config-dist.php, changing the database settings to match those from
   your old config.php (DB_* and TBL_PREFIX constants).  Save
   config-dist.php as config.php.
2. Load upgrade.php with your web browser.
3. After running that script your installation has been upgraded.
4. Either copy the files from the new installation over the old one, or
   point your users to the new location.

Upgrading from 1.0 RCx to 1.0 RC6
---------------------------------

PEAR and PEAR DB have been removed as of RC 6, so they must either be available
in the include path (system-wide install of PEAR) or their location should be
specified in the PEAR_PATH constant definition in config-dist.php.

Using the directory where you unpacked the new set of files...
1. Edit config-dist.php, changing the database settings to match those from
   your old config.php (DB_* and TBL_PREFIX constants).  Save
   config-dist.php as config.php.
2. Either copy the files from the new installation over the old one, or
   point your users to the new location.
   
There is no need to run the upgrade script.  The upgrade is complete.
