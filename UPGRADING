-----------------------------

A new table, project_group, has been added, and the auth_group table has been 
altered.

   your old config.php (DB_* and TBL_PREFIX constants).  Save config-dist.php 
   as config.php.
2. With your web browser, load upgrade.php from the directory where you 
   installed the new set of files.
3. After running that script your installation has been upgraded.
