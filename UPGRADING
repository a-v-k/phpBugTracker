Upgrading from 0.6.x to 0.7.1
-----------------------------

A new table, bug_vote, has been added, and new configuration variables have
been added.  

Following the steps below will upgrade your installation of phpBT.

1. Edit config-dist.php, changing the database settings to match those from
   your old config.php (DB_* and TBL_PREFIX constants).  Save config-dist.php 
   as config.php.
2. With your web browser, load upgrade.php from the directory where you 
   installed the new set of files.
3. After running that script your installation has been upgraded.

See the CHANGELOG file for more information on changes made since the last
version.
