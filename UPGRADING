Upgrading from 0.7.x to 0.8.x
-----------------------------

Two new tables, user_pref and bug_dependency have been added.  The handling
of sequences has been changed with the conversion to PEAR::DB, which causes
new *_seq tables to be created in MySQL and new sequences to be created in 
PostgreSQL.  Four new configuration values have been added to the configuration
table.  A new constant definition was added to config-dist.php, SMARTY_PATH,
which is used to specify the location of the smarty templates package.  This
constant should be an empty string ('') if smarty (http://smarty.php.net/) is
in your include path.

Following the steps below will upgrade your installation of phpBT.

1. Edit config-dist.php, changing the database settings to match those from
   your old config.php (DB_*, SMARTY_PATH and TBL_PREFIX constants).  Save 
   config-dist.php as config.php.
2. With your web browser, load upgrade.php from the directory where you 
   installed the new set of files.
3. After running that script your installation has been upgraded.

See the CHANGELOG file for more information on changes made since the last
version.
