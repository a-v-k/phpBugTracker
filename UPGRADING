Upgrading from 0.4.0 to 0.5.0
-----------------------------

The two support tables, active_sessions and db_sequence, now need to have
the same prefix as the other tables (if you are using a table prefix).  Also,
two new configuration options have been added.  

Following the steps below will upgrade your installation of phpBT.

1. Edit config-dist.php with the relevant details from your existing config.php.
   Make sure the DB_* and the TBL_PREFIX definitions are correct.
2. Save the file as config.php.
3. With your web browser, load upgrade.php from the directory where you 
   installed the new set of files.
4. After running that script your installation has been upgraded.

See the CHANGELOG file for more information on changes made since the last
version.
