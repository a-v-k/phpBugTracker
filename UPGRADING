Upgrading from 0.3.x to 0.4.0
-----------------------------

The admin templates have been moved from admin/templates/default to 
templates/default/admin, so if you have customized your templates you'll
want to move the admin templates to the new location.

The configure_db script can be run with the -u option to create the file
createdb.sql which will have the SQL commands necessary to update your database.
This release includes the creation of a new table, called configuration by
default, which stores the configuration information for the bug tracker.
