Upgrading from 0.9.1 to 1.0
---------------------------

First, backup your database!  This upgrade should go smoothly, but
if it doesn't, it's better to be safe than sorry.

Following the steps below will upgrade your installation of phpBT.

Using the directory where you unpacked the new set of files...
1. Edit config-dist.php, changing the database settings to match those from
   your old config.php (DB_* and TBL_PREFIX constants).  Save
   config-dist.php as config.php.
2. Load upgrade.php with your web browser.
3. After running that script your installation has been upgraded.
4. Either copy the files from the new installation over the old one, or
   point your users to the new location.
