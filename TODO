Bugs:
- Create bugs via email
- "Quick query" links (most active bugs, most serious bugs, unassigned bugs)

Users:
- User groups to be able to restrict user bug submissions to specific projects

Misc:
- Be able to color by priority instead of severity
- Conversion script from a bugzilla database
- Be able to change bug comments sort order (i.e., to most recent first) and be able to save a default for this setting in the config
- Move db abstraction to adodb (?)
