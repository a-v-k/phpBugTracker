Ok, here's the quick and dirty install instructions:

1. Edit the database creation script, changing the info for the Admin user.
2. Run the database creation script (currently only MySQL) by running
     "mysql -u <user> -p<password> < createdb.sql"
3. Install PHPlib (http://sourceforge.net/projects/phplib/) if it's not already
   installed.
4. Copy the directory tree from the tarball to a location suitable for serving
   web pages.
5. Run the configure script (somewhat experimental, but it should work)

				-- or --
				
5. Edit config.php as follows: 
   a. Change the INSTALLPATH and INSTALLURL variables to point the right 
	    locations.
   b. Change the ADMINEMAIL constant to what you want
   c. Change the database login info in class dbclass.  
   d. Change the ENCRYPTPASS constant to 1 if you want to have passwords stored
      encrypted in the database.
   e. Change the USE_JPGRAPH constant to 1 if you want to use the jpgraph class
	    (http://www.aditus.nu/jpgraph/) to display the bug summary info.  If you
			enable this you'll also need to edit the JPGRAPH_PATH constant, and 
			you'll need to edit the jpgraph.php file from the jpgraph disribution.
6. Browse on over to the installation, choose Admin tools, login with the info
   you put in the database creation script, and create your first project.
7. Start reporting bugs
