Ok, here's the quick and dirty install instructions:

Required: You must have PEAR and PEAR DB installed. If PEAR is not in the
include path, edit install.php in the test_database function, supplying the full
path to PEAR for the PEAR_PATH constant.
   
Optional: Install JpGraph (http://www.aditus.nu/jpgraph/) if you wish to use it.
	 
1. Copy the directory tree from the tarball to a location suitable for serving
   web pages.
	 
2. With your web browser, go the location where you installed the package. 
   You will be presented with a web page that will help you configure and 
   install the application.

3. After completing the installation, login and start reporting bugs.

* Note: You must have magic_quotes_gpc set to On either in php.ini or in 
.htaccess (see http://www.php.net/manual/en/configuration.php for more info).
