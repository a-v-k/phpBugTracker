Ok, here's the quick and dirty install instructions:

1. Edit the database creation script, changing the info for the Admin user.
2. Run the database creation script (currently only MySQL) by running
     "mysql -u <user> -p<password> < createdb.sql"
3. Edit include.php, changing the ADMINEMAIL constant to what you want and 
   changing the database login info in class dbclass.
4. Browse on over to the installation, choose Admin tools, login with the info
   you put in the database creation script, and create your first project.
5. Start reporting bugs
