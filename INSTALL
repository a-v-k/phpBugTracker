Ok, here's the quick and dirty install instructions:

Required: You must have PEAR and PEAR DB installed (See http://pear.php.net/).
If PEAR is not in the include path, edit install.php in the test_database
function, supplying the full path to PEAR for the PEAR_PATH constant.
 
Then:
1. Copy the directory tree to a location suitable for serving web pages.
	 
2. With your web browser, go the location where you installed the package. 
   You will be presented with a web page that will help you configure and 
   install the application.

3. After completing the installation, login and start reporting bugs.

Note:
You must have magic_quotes_gpc set to On either in php.ini or in 
.htaccess (see http://www.php.net/manual/en/configuration.php for more info).

Optional:
Install JpGraph (http://www.aditus.nu/jpgraph/) if you wish to use it.
Install Spreadsheet_Excel_Writer for bug list download support.
