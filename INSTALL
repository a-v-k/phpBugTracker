Ok, here's the quick and dirty install instructions:

1. Install PHPlib (http://sourceforge.net/projects/phplib/) if it's not already
   installed.  Note that with recent versions of PHP, PHPlib needs to be 
	 patched.  Please do the following with the patch file in this directory:
	   cat page.inc.patch | patch -p0 -b /path/to/phplib/page.inc
		 
	 Make sure you replace /path/to/phplib with the actual path to the installation
	 of phplib.  On windows systems you can edit page.inc and change line 67
	 from 'if (isset($user)) {' to 'if (isset($user) && $user) {' (without the 
	 quotes).
	 
	 Optional: Install JpGraph (http://www.aditus.nu/jpgraph/) if you wish to 
	 use it.
	 
2. Copy the directory tree from the tarball to a location suitable for serving
   web pages.
	 
3. With your web browser, go the location where you installed the package. 
   You will be presented with a web page that will help you configure and 
	 install the application.

4. After completing the installation, login and start reporting bugs.
