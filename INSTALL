Ok, here's the quick and dirty install instructions:

Optional: Install JpGraph (http://www.aditus.nu/jpgraph/) if you wish to use it.
	 
1. Copy the directory tree from the tarball to a location suitable for serving
   web pages.
	 
2. With your web browser, go the location where you installed the package. 
   You will be presented with a web page that will help you configure and 
	 install the application.

3. After completing the installation, login and start reporting bugs.

* Note: You must have register_globals set to On either in php.ini or in 
.htaccess.  This requirement will be removed in an upcoming version.
