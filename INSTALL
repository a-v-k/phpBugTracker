Ok, here's the quick and dirty install instructions:

1. Edit the database creation script, changing the info for the Admin user.
2. Run the database creation script (currently only MySQL) by running
     "mysql -u <user> -p<password> < createdb.sql"
1. Install PHPlib (http://sourceforge.net/projects/phplib/) if it's not already
   installed.
2. Copy the directory tree from the tarball to a location suitable for serving
   web pages.
3. Run the configure script.  This will change config.php (creating a backup) 
   and run configure_db which creates createdb.sql.

        -- or --
        
3. Configure manually.
   a. Edit the constants in config.php.
   b. Edit the variables in configure_db and run it to get createdb.sql.
4. If you want to use jpgraph (http://www.aditus.nu/jpgraph/) 
   to display the bug summary info, you will also need to edit 
	 jpgraph.php from the jpgraph disribution.
5. Edit createdb.sql, changing the admin info in the database insert.  You can 
   search on the text admin@example.com (around line 240).
6. Use createdb.sql to create your database.  With MySQL it can be done like
     mysql -h <db host> -u <username> -p<yourpassword> < createdb.sql
7. Browse on over to the installation, choose Admin tools, login with the info
   you put in the database creation script, and create your first project.
8. Start reporting bugs
