Ok, here's the quick and dirty install instructions:

Required: You must have PEAR and Pear::DB installed (See http://pear.php.net/).

PEAR usually comes with a command line client called "pear".  Try "pear list"
to show installed packages.  And check for "DB.php" which might typically
be found in "/usr/share/php/DB.php".
 
Then:
1. Copy the directory tree to a location suitable for serving web pages.
	 
2. With your web browser, go the location where you installed the package. 
   You will be presented with a web page that will help you configure and 
   install the application.  You may need to install a new "config.php"
   into the installation location.

3. After completing the installation, login, set up a project,
   and start reporting bugs.

Note:
You must have magic_quotes_gpc set to On either in php.ini or in .htaccess
(see http://www.php.net/manual/en/configuration.php for more info).

Optional:
Install JpGraph for home page graphs (http://www.aditus.nu/jpgraph/).
Install Spreadsheet_Excel_Writer for bug list download support ("pear install Spreadsheet_Excel_Writer-beta").
