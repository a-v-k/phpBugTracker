Ok, here's the quick and dirty install instructions:

Required:
You must have the PEAR library manager and Pear::DB installed (See http://pear.php.net/).
PEAR usually comes with a command line client called "pear".  Try "pear list"
to show installed packages:

xxxx> pear list
Installed packages, channel pear.php.net:
=========================================
Package                  Version State
Archive_Tar              1.3.2   stable
Console_Getopt           1.2.2   stable
DB                       1.7.12  stable
OLE                      0.5     beta
PEAR                     1.5.4   stable
Spreadsheet_Excel_Writer 0.9.1   beta
Structures_Graph         1.0.2   stable
 
Then:
1. Copy the directory tree to a location suitable for serving web pages.
	 
2. With your web browser, go the location where you installed the package. 
   You will be presented with a web page that will help you configure and 
   install the application.  You may need to download and copy a
   new "config.php" into the installation location.

3. If you get a blank page, check your web server's error logs for php errors.

4. After completing the installation, login, set up a project,
   and start reporting bugs.

Mandantory:
You must have magic_quotes_gpc set to On either in php.ini or in .htaccess
(see http://www.php.net/manual/en/configuration.php for more info).

Optional:
Install JpGraph for home page graphs (See http://www.aditus.nu/jpgraph/).  If you get error "Non-static method DB::isError() should not be called statically", then edit the JpGraph configuration to set "CATCH_PHPERRMSG" to false.

Install Spreadsheet_Excel_Writer for bug list download support ("pear install Spreadsheet_Excel_Writer-beta").


Performance Note:
phpBugTracker benefits a lot from a query cache, and will be unusable without one.
Most mysql platforms come with one enabled by default. If not, play with:

    SHOW VARIABLES LIKE 'query_cache_size';
    SHOW STATUS LIKE '%qcache%';
    SET  GLOBAL query_cache_size=256000;

mysql is the most tested database platform, followed by postgres, and then oracle.


Problems?
The majority of problems reported are with PEAR DB not working.  Edit PEAR_TEST.php to help work out these problems, before attempting the bug tracker.
