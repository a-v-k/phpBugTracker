Ok, here's the quick and dirty install instructions:

1. Install PHPlib (http://sourceforge.net/projects/phplib/) if it's not already
   installed.  Note that with recent versions of PHP, PHPlib needs to be 
	 patched.  Please do the following with the patch file in this directory:
	   cat page.inc.patch | patch -p0 -b /path/to/phplib/page.inc
		 
	 Make sure you replace /path/to/phplib with the actual path to the installation
	 of phplib.  On windows systems you can edit page.inc and change line 67
	 from 'if (isset($user)) {' to 'if (isset($user) && $user) {' (without the 
	 quotes).
	 
	 Optional: Install JpGraph (http://www.aditus.nu/jpgraph/) if you wish to 
	 use it.
	 
2. Copy the directory tree from the tarball to a location suitable for serving
   web pages.
	 
3. Run configure_db, which creates createdb.sql.  Use the -h option when running
   configure_db to see the options.  You can also edit the options being 
	 inserted into the configuration table or edit them later from the web 
	 interface.
	 
4. Edit createdb.sql, changing the admin info in the database insert.  You can 
   search on the text admin@example.com (around line 240).
	 
5. Use createdb.sql to create your database.  With MySQL it can be done like
     mysql -h <db host> -u <username> -p<yourpassword> < createdb.sql
		 
6. Browse on over to the installation, choose Admin tools, login with the info
   you put in the database creation script, and create your first project.
	 
7. Start reporting bugs
