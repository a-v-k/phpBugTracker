    <title>Creating an account</title>

    <para>You can create a new account by following the link labeled <emphasis role="bold">Open a new account</emphasis>.  To create a new account you will need to enter at least a valid email address (so that your password can be mailed to you).  Providing your name is optional, but if you submit it then your name will appear with bugs you submit and comments you make.  If the system has been configured to use a login separate from the email address, you will also be prompted for a login.  If you have chosen an email address (or login) that is already in use, you will be prompted to choose a different one.  After completing this form, your password will be mailed to you.  Once you have received your password you can then login with your email (or login) and password to be able to submit bugs.</para>

    <para>Once you have logged in to the system you can follow the <emphasis role="bold">Enter Bug</emphasis> link from the top navigation bar to create a new bug.  If there is more than one project for which you can submit a bug, you will be prompted to choose one.</para>

    <para>Once you have chosen a project, or if there is only one project in the system, you will see the bug entry page.  The <emphasis role="bold">Version</emphasis> and <emphasis role="bold">Component</emphasis> fields allow you to specify details about which part or version of the product that produces this bug.  The <emphasis role="bold">Summary</emphasis> field should be a short but specific summary of the problem, while the <emphasis role="bold">Description</emphasis> field should include details about the behavior observed, how that behavior differs from expected behavior, and the steps to reproduce the problem.  If the product being tested is web-based, you can use the <emphasis role="bold">URL</emphasis> field to provide a link directly to the problem.  The <emphasis role="bold">Add another</emphasis> checkbox, if checked, will present another bug entry form when you submit a bug, instead of taking you to the bug list.</para>
