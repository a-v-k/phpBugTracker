Development Standards				This document will contain the coding and process standards to be 
				followed by the developers working on phpBugTracker.
			Coding StandardsIndenting				Use an indent of one tab per indent.
			Control Structures				These include if, for, while, switch, etc. Here is an example if 
				statement, since it is the most complicated of them:
			  if ((condition1) || (condition2)) {
    action1;
  } elseif ((condition3) &#38;&#38; (condition4)) {
    action2;
  } else {
    defaultaction;
  }
							Control statements should have one space between the control keyword 
				and opening parenthesis, to distinguish them from function calls.
							You are strongly encouraged to always use curly braces even in 
				situations where they are technically optional. Having them increases 
				readability and decreases the likelihood of logic errors being 
				introduced when new lines are added.
			Function Calls				Functions should be called with no spaces between the function name, 
				the opening parenthesis, and the first parameter; spaces between 
				commas and each parameter, and no space between the last parameter, 
				the closing parenthesis, and the semicolon. Here's an example:
			  $var = foo($bar, $baz, $quux);
							As displayed above, there should be one space on either side of an 
				equals sign used to assign the return value of a function to a variable.
			Function Calls				Function definitions follow the format of function calls, with the 
				opening brace at the end of the line of the function declaration. The 
				global variable list (if used) should be placed on the line immediately 
				following the opening brace, with a blank line between the variable 
				list and the first line of function code. If the global variable list 
				is not neccessary, include a blank line between the opening brace and 
				the first line of function code.
			  function fooFunction($arg1, $arg2 = '') {
    global $foo1, $foo2;

    if (condition) {
      statement;
    }
    return $val;
  }
							Arguments with default values go at the end of the argument list.  
				Always attempt to return a meaningful value from a function if one is 
				appropriate. Here is a slightly longer example:
			  function connect(&#38;$dsn, $persistent = false) {

    if (is_array($dsn)) {
      $dsninfo = &#38;$dsn;
    } else {
      $dsninfo = DB::parseDSN($dsn);
    }

    if (!$dsninfo || !$dsninfo['phptype']) {
      return $this-&#62;raiseError();
    }

    return true;
  }
			Comments				Non-documentation comments are strongly encouraged. A general rule of 
				thumb is that if you look at a section of code and think "Wow, I don't 
				want to try and describe that", you need to comment it before you 
				forget how it works.
			Including Code				Anywhere you are unconditionally including a class file, use 
								require_once(). Anywhere you are 
				conditionally including a class file (for example, factory methods), 
				use 				include_once(). Either of these will 
				ensure that class files are included only once. They share the same file 
				list, so you don't need to worry about mixing them - a file included 
				with require_once() will not be included again by 
				include_once().
			PHP Tags				Always use &#60;?php ?&#62; 
				to delimit PHP code, not the &#60;? ?&#62; 
				shorthand.
			Naming Constants				Constants should always be uppercase, with underscores to separate 
				words.
			Other ConventionsFile Naming				File names should be all lowercase and contain no spaces. HTML files 
				should have .html as the extension, and PHP files 
				should have .php as the extension. Where possible, 
				template files should match the name of the PHP file that will be using 
				it, e. g., index.html would be the template file 
				for index.php. Where one PHP file uses more than one 
				templates, the templates should be similarly named: 
				user.php could use 
				userlist.html and userform.html 
				for a list of users and editing a user, respectively.
