So, don't use this project in open networks.
I will work on this problem.

- convert localization files to utf8 (non-utf language packs not supported now)
- search for and fix security issues

Introduction
------------
Thanks for taking a look at phpBugTracker.  This project was started out of the
frustation I experienced getting Bugzilla installed and operational for a web
development project.  The goals of this project are to produce a web-based bug
tracker with functionality similar to bugzilla that is abstracted from the
database backend and uses templates for rendering the pages.  

Currently phpBugTracker is nowhere near a drop-in replacement for Bugzilla, so
don't expect it to be.  Maybe it will get to that point one day, maybe it won't,
but either way I'm trying to make it a capable bug tracker.  I hope you enjoy 
using phpBugTracker, and that you find it useful.
