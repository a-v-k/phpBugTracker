Introduction
------------
Thanks for taking a look at phpBugTracker.  This project was started out of the
frustation I experienced getting Bugzilla installed and operational for a web
development project.  The goals of this project are to produce a web-based bug
tracker with functionality similar to bugzilla that is abstracted from the
database backend and uses templates for rendering the pages.  

Currently phpBugTracker is nowhere near a drop-in replacement for Bugzilla, so
don't expect it to be.  Maybe it will get to that point one day, maybe it won't,
but either way I'm trying to make it a capable bug tracker.  I hope you enjoy 
using phpBugTracker, and that you find it useful. 

Comments and suggestions are always welcome, either at the SourceForge page at

Requirements
------------

Here is a list of the requirements to get this running on your server.
1. A webserver
2. PHP with support for your database and MagicQuotes. 
   **Without MagicQuotes, escaping in comments will not work correctly**
3. A database - Currently MySQL, Oracle and PostgreSQL have been tested,
   though the goal is to be database independent.  The query routine is a 
   notable exception to that goal at the moment.
