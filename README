Note about security
-------------------
Original phpBugTracker has many security bugs. This project inherits it.
At version 1.7.2 I was fixed all security vulnerabilities, detected on that moment.
And I still working on it.

I need code contributions for:
------------------------------
- convert localization files to utf8 (non-utf language packs not supported now)
- search for and fix security issues

Requirements
------------
Here is a list of the requirements to get this running on your server.
1. A webserver
2. PHP 5.2+ (with PDO and MySQL driver)
3. A database - Currently MySQL only.

Introduction
------------
Thanks for taking a look at phpBugTracker.  This project was started out of the
frustation I experienced getting Bugzilla installed and operational for a web
development project.  The goals of this project are to produce a web-based bug
tracker with functionality similar to bugzilla that is abstracted from the
database backend and uses templates for rendering the pages.  

Currently phpBugTracker is nowhere near a drop-in replacement for Bugzilla, so
don't expect it to be.  Maybe it will get to that point one day, maybe it won't,
but either way I'm trying to make it a capable bug tracker.  I hope you enjoy 
using phpBugTracker, and that you find it useful.
