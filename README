Thanks for taking a look at phpBugTracker.  This project was started out of the
frustation I experienced getting Bugzilla installed and operational for a web
development project.  The goals of this project are to produce a web-based bug
tracker with functionality similar to bugzilla that is abstracted from the
database backend and uses templates for rendering the pages.  

Currently phpBugTracker is nowhere near a drop-in replacement for Bugzilla, so
don't expect it to be.  Maybe it will get to that point one day, maybe it won't.
If it doesn't meet your needs, your development help is welcome, but your
whining isn't!  Just remember that I do this in my very limited spare time for 
fun, and I hope others can enjoy what little I have done/will do on it.  That
said, I hope you enjoy using phpBugTracker, and that you find it useful. 
Comments and suggestions are always welcome, either at the SourceForge page at
