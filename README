Note
------------

This project is a fork of phpBugTracker (http://phpbt.sourceforge.net/).

* Why a fork ?
- Original project is closed by author and has no commit since 2009
- I need some features that original project doesn't have.

All contributions (code or bug reports) are welcome! 

History of changes since forked from phpBugTracker
--------------------------------------------------

Allow filter bugs by project (in progress)!
Many of html code fixed (in progress)
Fixed bug sort order in some places.
Database switched to UTF-8 codepage. (Autoupdate not supported)
Removed magic_quotes_gpc dependence!
Oracle and PostgreSQL support was stopped since 2009. If you need this - 
	you can make it self and contribute your code, 
	or order donation based support. 
Added Smarty templates support.	
	
WARNING!
--------
Original phpBugTracker has many security bugs. This project inherits it.
So, don't use this project in open networks.
I will work on this problem.

I need code contributions for:
------------------------------
- check and fix install script for current project state (db converted to utf8)
- convert localization files to utf8 (non-utf language packs not supported now) 

Requirements
------------
Here is a list of the requirements to get this running on your server.
1. A webserver
2. PHP 5.2+
3. A database - Currently MySQL with mysqli.

Introduction
------------
Thanks for taking a look at phpBugTracker.  This project was started out of the
frustation I experienced getting Bugzilla installed and operational for a web
development project.  The goals of this project are to produce a web-based bug
tracker with functionality similar to bugzilla that is abstracted from the
database backend and uses templates for rendering the pages.  

Currently phpBugTracker is nowhere near a drop-in replacement for Bugzilla, so
don't expect it to be.  Maybe it will get to that point one day, maybe it won't,
but either way I'm trying to make it a capable bug tracker.  I hope you enjoy 
using phpBugTracker, and that you find it useful.
